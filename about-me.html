<span id="header">
    Hi there!
</span>

<div id="body">
    <p>
        I'm <span class="bold orange underline">Nikola</span>, an aspiring web developer with a passion for
        <span class="green">functional, fluid and fun</span>
        UIs
        <span class="italic">(in case this website didn't already give that away)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this current stage, my portfolio is <span class="bold">very</span> bare-bones, but it serves as a great
        proof-of-concept of the capabilities provided by modern <span class="orange">HTML</span>, <span class="blue">CSS</span>
        and <span class="yellow">JavaScript</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, you're <span class="bold">more than free</span> to explore the structure of this website as much as
        you'd like. I've made it as intuitive as it can get, try it!
